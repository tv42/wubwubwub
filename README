In order to avoid modifying the configuration files so maintainer updates
can happen smoothly, please put local configuration files in
/etc/twisted-web/local.d
All .py files in this directory are evaluated according to lexical order.
It is recommended files will begin with two digits to set the order.
All example drop-in configuation files follow this convention.   

Drop-in configuration files are evaluated inside a namespace consisting
of 
- root -- the root resource, usually a NameVirtualHost
- site -- a web.server.Site, the factory
- application -- a twisted.internet.app.Application

For more explanations about how Twisted.Web works, pleases see the
"Using Twisted.Web" HOWTO, available at
/usr/share/doc/twisted-doc/howto/using-twistedweb.xhtml when you
install the "twisted-doc" package.

If some other program is running on port 80 Twisted-Web will be disabled until
you change /etc/twisted-web/disable to be empty. You should do this after
changing the configuration of Twisted-Web to listen on some other port, or
changing the configuration of the other server. After undisabling Twisted-Web,
run the command "invoke-rc.d twisted-web" to start the server manually.

rptwisted exists to run Twisted on an out-of-the-way port and prepare it
to be a reverse proxy.  It will reconfigure Twisted-Web to run on another
port, and will also, optionally, drop a file in Apache2's configuration
directory to reverse proxy a named virtual host to the Twisted-Web server.

If you don't use the option to generate the Apache2 virtual host configuration,
or if you want to add more virtual host configurations, here is the template
for a file to drop in /etc/apache2/sites-available:

'''
<VirtualHost *>
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8538/vhost/http/example.com:80/
ServerName example.com
</VirtualHost>
'''

Remember to symlink it to sites-enabled, and restart Apache2!
