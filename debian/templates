_Description: Cannot bind to port 80
 Some other server is bound to TCP port 80, the port for webservers.
 Wubwubwub will be disabled until you change /etc/wubwubwub/disable to
 be empty. You should do this after changing the configuration of
 Wubwubwub to listen on some other port, or changing the configuration of
 the other server. After undisabling Wubwubwub, run the command
 "invoke-rc.d wubwubwub" to start the server manually.
 .
 If you wish to run Wubwubwub on some other port and reverse-proxy a
 specific virtual host to it, please see the rptwisted(8) program.
