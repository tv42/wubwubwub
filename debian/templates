Template: twisted-web/cant-bind
Type: note
Description: Cannot bind to port 80
 Some other server is bound to TCP port 80, the port for webservers.
 Twisted-Web will be disabled until you change /etc/twisted-web/disable
 to be empty. You should do this after changing the configuration of
 Twisted-Web to listen on some other port, or changing the configuration
 of the other server. After undisabling Twisted-Web, run the command
 "invoke-rc.d twisted-web" to start the server manually.
 .
 If you wish to run Twisted-Web on some other port and reverse-proxy
 a specific virtual host to it, please see the rptwisted(8) program.
